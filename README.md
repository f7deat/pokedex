# Deploy

## Deploy to GitHub pages

Another simple way to deploy your Angular app is to use GitHub Pages.

- You need to create a GitHub account if you don't have one, and then create a repository for your project. Make a note of the user name and project name in GitHub.

- Build your project using Github project name, with the Angular CLI command ng build: `ng build --prod --output-path docs --base-href /<project_name>/`

- When the build is complete, make a copy of docs/index.html and name it docs/404.html.

- Commit your changes and push.

- On the GitHub project page, configure it to publish from the docs folder.

You can see your deployed page at `https://<user_name>.github.io/<project_name>/`
